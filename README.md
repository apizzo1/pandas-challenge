Heroes of Pymoli

Please note: for the Most Popular Items  task, my dataframe shows slightly different data than what is seen in the example answers. The last 3 items in the example answers show items with a purchase count of 9, but there are actually 4 items with a purchase count of 9. My dataframe happens to show Nirvana (the fourth item with a purchase count of 9) while the example answer shows Fiery Glass Crusader.
