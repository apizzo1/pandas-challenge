Heroes of Pymoli

Please note: for the Most Popular Items  task, my dataframe shows slightly different data than what is seen in the example answers. The last 3 items in the example answers show items with a purchase count of 9, but there are actually 4 items with a purchase count of 9. My dataframe happens to show Nirvana (the fourth item with a purchase count of 9) while the example answer shows Fiery Glass Crusader.

Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis

1. Age range 35-39 shows the highest average purchase price ($3.60) and highest average total purchase per person ($4.76). Meanwhile, although the <10 age demographic does not have a large amount of players, they have the second highest average total purchase per person ($4.54) of all the age ranges.

2. While the age range of 20-24 has the greatest number of players, it also has the greatest number of purchases (365) and makes up 46.8% of all purchases. It can also be noted that the number of players correlates positively with the number of purchase per age group. This means that the >40 age range has the least number of players and also the least number of purchases.

3. Unsurprisingly, the most profitable items are all over $4.20, which is significantly higher than the $3.05 average purchase price. However, the top 2 most profitable items (Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm) are not the most expensive items available, and are still the most profitable items in the game.
